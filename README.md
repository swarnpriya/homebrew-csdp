homebrew-csdp
==============

A small (experimental) tap for the [Homebrew project](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) to install [CSDP](https://projects.coin-or.org/Csdp). 

After installing Homebrew, you must install a fortran compiler, and some version of BLAS and LAPACK.

```
$ brew update
$ brew install gfortran
$ brew install openblas
$ brew tap swarnpriya/homebrew-csdp
$ brew install csdp
```
